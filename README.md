# Obsidian Automatic Tags

Add tags to new notes automatically based on their path.

## Configuration

There is one config option: a mapping of paths to tags. The path uses a simplified Glob format.

Comments are not allowed, but are included here for documentation purposes.

```
*: all # apply the 'all' tag to all new markdown files
physics/: physics # apply the 'physics' tag to all new files in the 'physics' folder
```

## Installation

_Plugin is pending approval on Obsidian website._
